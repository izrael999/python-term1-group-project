Project Description

The Number Analyzer Program is a Python application that asks the user to enter a number and then analyzes that number in three different ways:

Determines whether the number is Even or Odd

Determines whether the number is Positive, Negative, or Zero

Determines whether the number is Prime or Not Prime

This project demonstrates basic Python programming concepts such as:

User input

Conditional statements

Loops

Mathematical operations

Logical problem solving

The program is suitable for beginners learning Python.
