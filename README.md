The Grading System is a beginner-level Python program designed to calculate a student’s academic grade based on five subject marks. The program collects input from the user, computes the average score, and then determines the appropriate grade using conditional statements.
This project was created to practice and demonstrate understanding of basic Python programming concepts such as user input, variables, arithmetic operations, and decision-making structures.
 Objective of the Program
The main objective of this program is to:
Accept five marks entered by the user.
Calculate the total and average of the marks.
Assign a grade according to a predefined grading scale.
Display the final average and grade clearly to the user.
This program helps students understand how grading systems work logically and how decision-making is implemented in programming.
 Grading Criteria
The program uses the following grading scale:
Average Score	Grade
80 and above	A+
70 – 79  	A
60 – 69	        B
50 – 59	        C
Below 50	F
The grade is determined using if, elif, and else statements.
The program demonstrates:
User input
Variables
Arithmetic calculations
Conditional statements (if, elif, else)
Basic Python output
